STEP BY STEP (NOT AI GENERATED BWHAHAHA) FOR FIRST RUN/INITIALIZATION

1. Install Docker Desktor and Download the sql file from MCO1
2. Put the Sql file inside /sql/source_init
3. Clone Github Repo
4. Do the Command “docker-compose up -d”
5. Check if its working “docker-compose ps”
6. Check if done loading “docker-compose logs mysql-source” (just copy paste the log and ask ai to see if the sql file is uploaded correctly in the db)
7. Connect it to SQLTools or do ur sql workbench sht (can’t help u w the latter)
8. Test it if it works
9. To stop the session do “docker-compose down”

DATABASE CONNECTION DETAILS:
Source DB: localhost:3306, financedata, app_user, rootpass
Warehouse DB: localhost:3307, warehouse_db, warehouse_user, rootpass

STEP BY STEP
1. Do the Command “docker-compose up -d”
2. To stop the session do “docker-compose down”

THIS WILL BE OUR BASE/FOUNDATION

1. What will we do now?
	- Create the ETL Script with Python
	- Meaning we have to connect mysql to python. I didn’t put python since it will be updated every time so it’ll be slow if we put it in docker

2. Create the SCHEMA for our Data Warehouse
	- Which idk wtf to do pa. TBD in the meeting

3. OLAP Application 
    - Web interface with complex queries

4. Functional Testing 
    - Test your queries

5. Performance Testing 
    - Optimize with indexes

6. Technical Report 
    - Document everything
